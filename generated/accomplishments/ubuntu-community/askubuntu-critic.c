// First down vote
// Voting down is how the Ask Ubuntu community indicates which questions and answers are least useful. Use your down-votes whenever you encounter an egregiously sloppy, no-effort-expended post, or an answer that is clearly and perhaps dangerously incorrect.
// You have a limited number of votes per day and answer down-votes cost you a tiny bit of reputation on top of that so use them wisely. Normally, you should focus on pushing great content to the top by up-voting: this is why down-voting should on the contrary be reserved for extreme cases. It is not meant as a substitute for communication and editing.
// Instead of voting down, consider flagging the post if it is spammy or offensive, or flagging it for moderator attention if the question is duplicate or off-topic. Always leave a comment for the poster and the community or edit the post to correct it.
